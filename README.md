## Template for webpack repository

1. Use this repo as a template, following [these intructions](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template)
2. Setup:

```
npm install
npm build
```

... and it's ready to go

Note:

- I have gitignored the font files as they are the property of [Threedotstype](https://threedotstype.com/product/di-grotesk/)
- currently the fonts are not loaded as expected
