    <h3>Ford vs Selden engine story</h3>

                Let's start with a story. In 1875 patent attorney George Selden has filed a patent for a Road Engine. Inspired by 
                internal combustion engine invented by George Brayton, he created a smaller version... on wheels. 
                Attempts to build a car to the patent’s specifications ended in failure but 
                stretching the patent process over the next 16 years, Selden's associates broadened it to cover every gasoline-powered car built.
                Full story is fascinating and can be read for example at <a href="https://fee.org/articles/how-henry-ford-zapped-a-licensing-monopoly/">Foundation

                Long story short this meant that as a car manufacture in the US you had to pay royalities to the Electic Vehicle Company (that's another story!!)
                and later to the Association of Licensed Automobile Manufacturers, even if the car did not use any parts of the patent.
                Henry Ford was not able to obtain a licence and in 1903 was sued for patent infrindgement. After a long legal battle 
                in 1911 Ford won his case based on an argument that the engine used in automobiles was not based on George Brayton's engine, 
                the Brayton engine which Selden had improved <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_B._Selden">(George B Selden)</a>
                The result was that the Selden patent became virtually worthless and a new association was formed. 
                The new association instituted a cross-licensing agreement among all US auto manufacturers: although each company would develop 
                technology and file patents, these patents were shared openly and without the exchange of money. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_free_and_open-source_software">(History of free and open source software)</a>()
                Note: this is not endoresement of cross-licensing agreements, we don't know what they are.

    <h3>Open-source software</h3>
    <p>
        The term open source refers to something people can modify and share because its design is publicly accessible.
        <a href="https://opensource.com/resources/what-open-source">(What is open source?)</a>
        However, using or distributing something open-source does not, however mean complete freedom of use. Often the "thing"
        comes with a licence that, for example guards againts distributing it for profits.
        Open source does not have to be bad for business though. Programmers often ask for donations for usage of their software,
        releasing code can also be a good way of marketing your company. Very often the income comes from additional
        services or out of the box solutions. <a href="https://opensource.com/business/14/7/interview-Patrick-McFadin-Datastax">Read more</a></p>
    <h3>Licensing</h3>
    <div class="image-text">
        <p>
            So why do we need licensing? Selden story is not unique and what he did is called patent "trolling". Anyway by
        adding a license to your software you can protect it against someone trying to charge others to use it. 
        There are many licenses and it can feel overwhelming, thankfully there is this open-source tool created by Github 
        (which is a very profitable company) to help you choose: <a href="https://choosealicense.com/">Choose licence</a>. And you can contribite to it too!
        Finally, you don't need to open source your code, it's ok not too. You do you!

    <h3>Open source world</h3>
    <p>
        Open source does not apply only to software. More generally it means expressing a willingness to share, 
        collaborating with others in ways that are transparent (so that others can watch and join too), 
        embracing failure as a means of improving, and expecting—even encouraging—everyone else to do the same.
        It can also apply to art and design. More concretely if you are a creative you can use the Creative Common 
        license to share (and/or protect) your work. CC - an international non-profit provides easy to use licences with different protection levels: <a href="https://creativecommons.org/about/cclicenses/">CC Licences</a>
