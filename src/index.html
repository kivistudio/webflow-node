                        Let's start with a story. In 1875 patent attorney George Selden has filed a patent for a Road Engine. Inspired by 
                        internal combustion engine invented by George Brayton, he created a smaller version... on wheels. 
                        Attempts to build a car to the patent’s specifications ended in failure but 
                        stretching the patent process over the next 16 years, Selden's associates broadened it to cover every gasoline-powered car built.
                        <span class="kivi-red">&#9679;</span></p>
                        <p>
                        Long story short this meant that as a car manufacture in the US you had to pay royalties to the Electric Vehicle Company (that's another story!! <span class="kivi-green">&#9679;</span>)
                        and later to the Association of Licensed Automobile Manufacturers, even if the car did not use any parts of the patent.
                        Henry Ford was not able to obtain a license and in 1903 was sued for patent infringement. After a long legal battle 
                        in 1911 Ford won his case based on an argument that the engine used in automobiles was not based on George Brayton's <span class="kivi-yellow">&#9679;</span> engine, 
                        which the patent was based on.
                        The result was that the Selden patent became virtually worthless and a new association was formed. 
                        The new association instituted a cross-licensing agreement among all US auto manufacturers: although each company would develop 
                        technology and file patents, these patents were shared openly and without the exchange of money. <span class="kivi-black">&#9679;</span>

                The term open source refers to something people can modify and share because its design is publicly accessible.<span class="kivi-red">&#9679;</span>
                However, using or distributing something open-source does not mean complete freedom of use. Often the "thing"
                comes with a license that, for example, guards against distributing it for profits.
                Open source does not have to be bad for business either. Programmers often ask for donations for usage of their software,
                releasing code can also be a good way of marketing your company. Very often the income comes from additional
                services or out of the box solutions. <span class="kivi-green">&#9679;</span>

                        Anyway by adding a license to your software you can protect it against someone trying to charge others to use it. 
                        There are many licenses and it can feel overwhelming, but there is an open-source tool created by Github<span class="kivi-green">&#9679;</span>

                Open source does not apply only to software. More generally it means expressing a willingness to share, 
                collaborating with others in ways that are transparent (so that others can watch and join too), 
                embracing failure as a means of improving, and expecting—even encouraging—everyone else to do the same. <span class="kivi-red">&#9679;</span>
